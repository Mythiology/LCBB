# Lightweight Cookie Baking Box (LCBB)
LCBB is a firefox based browser extension, designed to ease the pain of copying sessions picked up from AiTM frameworks such as Evilginx and Muraena. 
This tool was created during Div0 Hacksmith 5.0

## Who is this for?
Anyone who want to make their life easy by integrating with existing AiTM frameworks. 

## What is working
Backend which fetch from your desired in-memory store or database. (You have to implement your own database/in-memory)
*PoC in this case only shows harcoded cookie from an example output of Muraena.

## What is not working
Setting of firefox SOCKS5 is not working for extension. (maybe some help here?)
